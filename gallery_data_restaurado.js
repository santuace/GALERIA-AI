        prompt: "A lone figure, seen from behind, walking on a snow-dusted, rocky path. The figure wears a long, light blue or grey coat and carries a backpack. The path leads towards a distant settlement of white, rounded buildings with domed roofs, nestled among craggy, reddish-brown rock formations. The landscape is a vast, icy plain with patches of snow and exposed rocks, suggesting a cold, barren environment. In the far distance, faint, angular objects (possibly spacecraft or distant structures) are visible against a pale blue sky. The overall style should be a detailed, hand-drawn illustration with a slight watercolor or ink wash feel, emphasizing natural textures and a sense of solitude and vastness. --sref 889962737 --v 7 --profile h9pgy68 --ar 4:5",

	prompt: "A bright, hyper-realistic medium shot opens on a gleaming kitchen studio where Gargamel, a thin, obscure 50-years old man with crooked teeth, clad in his signature black robe with tattered sleeves, stands behind a polished marble counter brimming with cooking utensils, herb jars, a steaming cauldron, and an opened mason jar full of very little smurf moving inside. Some Smurfs escaped the mason jar and they are running around the marble counter, in panic. Audio: Crisp, clear capture of Gargamel’s deep, gravelly voice as he looks directly into the camera and says, “Hello, welcome to GargaChef, my cooking channel. Today I’m going to teach you how to make my famous Smurf Soup.” Underlying ambient sounds include gentle bubbling from the cauldron, rhythmic knife chops on a wooden cutting board, and a soft, upbeat cooking-show jingle fading under his dialogue. The camera, mounted on a smooth Steadicam rig, stands still, framing Gargamel’s animated expression as he cheerfully addresses the audience while he chops carrots, then he puts down the knife and grabs a Smurf from the mason jar and toss it into de pot. Composed with Gargamel centered and ingredients arrayed along the lower third of the frame, vibrant pops of Smurf-blue contrast the warm wooden cabinetry and gleaming metal surfaces. Captured in 8K on a RED Komodo with a 50 mm vintage Panavision lens, this scene boasts razor-sharp detail—every droplet of broth, every glint on a silver ladle—enhanced by a crisp, true-to-life color grade and ultra-subtle film grain, perfectly simulating a high-end culinary show",
